# Library Management System

The Library Management System (LMS) is an application that allows
users to create a database of sample library data, loan, and return books.

## Setup

To use this application, download the zip file or add this repository 
on your local machine.
Open a shell or terminal (cmd, powershell, bash) and run the virutal environment
`PATH .venv/Scripts/activate`
Then run the `main.py` file in the application.  From there you will have options to choose from.

1. Setup database
2. Add Sample Data
3. Loan a Book
4. Return a Book
5. Exit

If the database or sample data exist, you'll encounter an error saying that exist.
To add a new database, delete the `library.db` and `schema.sql` files in the `database` directory.

## Open Source

Feel free to build on this application.  This application was a project I worked on to showcase how 
a management system works utilizing a simulated environment.
